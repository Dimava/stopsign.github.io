level design
    tutorial improvements
        unable to click except
        highlight
        option to skip
    levels scale in time from ~1 minute to ~15 minutes over ~20 levels
    make a random level generator?
    1 time prizes of WIS/INT on *very* difficult dungeons every few levels, starting at 5
    increasing gold prizes and EXP for clearing each level to entice players to stay at peak
extras tab
    polls

make clearSave work (defaults in load());
QoL auto-add sleep when you can't do a task
reset and clear all lists button

heroes
    purpose
        Make combat more interesting and less one-dimensional
        build up over time
        can't be accessed immediately in the level - requires minimal propagation
unit statistics


image pooling for lists
image pooling for map
browsers
mobile


additional ideas -
    bestiary to show unit types
        simulate combat
    need more goals than "overcome next wall". Consider sprawling in a different direction?
        dungeons for king/heroes
        research technologies / magic
        alternate uses of soul crystals
        new power systems / damage types
        inner world growth
        apprentice

    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward

Questions -
    Better way to re-arrange Stats? Or Extras?
